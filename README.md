## **Note:**
Everyone in team discussed & used their own logic and came up with their different or same solution. First we tried to learn React js , Node js and started woking on the same. Because of lack of knowledge, errors and problems occured using Reactjs some members started working on HTML, JAVA Servlet, PHP server & MySql and created the dashboards for teachers and students module and also we kept working on reactjs . At the end we decided to push all the codes on gitHub repository
